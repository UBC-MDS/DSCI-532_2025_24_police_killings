# Data-Driven Dashboard of Police Killings

## Summary

This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard that provides accessible, data-driven insights into police killings based on demographic, time, and geographic factors.

By visualizing trends over time, identifying high-risk locations, and analyzing correlations between demographic characteristics and police use of force, the dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for government officials, policymakers, and the general public.

The goal is to raise awareness, inform policy changes, and support social justice organizations in advocating for better law enforcement training and accountability measures.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

Police use of excessive (and lethal) force is a major societal issue, disproportionately affecting underprivileged communities. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of accessible, data-driven insights that can help raise awareness and inform policy changes to mitigate instances of police brutality.

### The solution

This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard that provides accessible insights into police killings based on demographic, geographic, and time-based factors.
With this tool, users can: 
*  Explore police killings data over time.
*  Identify high-risk locations through heatmaps.
*  Analyze trends across different demographic groups.
*  Support policy decisions with real-time data visualization.
By providing a structured data-driven approach, this platform helps policymakers, government officials, and the public better understand disparities in law enforcement practices and advocate for change.
 
## Who are we?

The Data-Driven Dashboard of Police Killings project is developed by a team of researchers and data scientists dedicated to using data for social justice.
Contributors include Tingting Chen, Shawn Xiao Hu, Adrian Leung, and Rong Wan, as part of the UBC DSCI 532 Capstone project. This work is supported by advocates, policymakers, and data ethics researchers.
 
## What do we need?

We welcome contributions in various areas, including:
*  Data Science & Engineering: Improving the quality of data aggregation and analysis.
*  Web Development: Enhancing dashboard usability and scalability.
*  Policy Research: Providing context for better interpretation of results.
*  Community Outreach: Engaging with organizations and stakeholders.
If you have experience in any of these areas (or others we haven't considered yet!), we'd love your input!

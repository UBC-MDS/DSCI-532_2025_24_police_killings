# Data-Driven Dashboard of Police Killings

## Summary

This project develops an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze police killings in the U.S. from 2015-2016. Built with **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **Altair**, it provides accessible, data-driven insights into trends and patterns based on **demographic**, **geographic**, and **time-based factors**. The dashboard serves as a tool for **policymakers**, **researchers**, and the **public** to explore data, identify disparities, and advocate for accountability and reform.

## What Are We Doing?

### The Problem

Police use of excessive and lethal force disproportionately impacts marginalized communities. A lack of accessible, data-driven insights hinders efforts to address these issues and inform policy changes.

### The Solution

This dashboard offers an interactive platform to:
- **Explore police killings data over time**.
- **Identify high-risk locations** through heatmaps.
- **Analyze trends across demographic groups** (e.g., race, age, armed status).
- **Support evidence-based policy decisions** with real-time data visualization.

By visualizing critical data, the dashboard aims to **raise awareness**, **inform advocacy**, and **drive systemic change**.

## Who Are We?

This project is developed by a team of researchers and data scientists committed to using data for social justice. Contributors include **Tingting Chen**, **Shawn Xiao Hu**, **Adrian Leung**, and **Rong Wan**, as part of the **UBC DSCI 532** project. We are supported by **advocates**, **policymakers**, and **data ethics researchers**.

## What Do We Need?

We welcome contributions in:
- **Data Science & Engineering**: Improve data aggregation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Web Development**: Enhance dashboard usability, performance, and scalability.
- **Policy Research**: Provide context for interpreting results and connecting data to real-world implications.
- **Community Outreach**: Engage with stakeholders, organizations, and affected communities.

If you have expertise in these areas—or others—we’d love your input!

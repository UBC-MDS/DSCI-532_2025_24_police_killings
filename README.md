Data-Driven Insights into Police Use of Force

Summary:

This project aims to develop an interactive data visualization dashboard that provides accessible, data-driven insights into police killings based on demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic factors.

By visualizing trends over time, identifying high-risk locations, and analyzing correlations between demographic characteristics and police use of force, the dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for government officials, policymakers, and the general public.

The goal is to raise awareness, inform policy changes, and support social justice organizations in advocating for better law enforcement training and accountability measures.

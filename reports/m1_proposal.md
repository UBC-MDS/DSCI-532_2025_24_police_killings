# Tentative - Dashboard proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our Role: Data Scientist Consultancy Firm 
Target Audience: Government officials, policymakers, general public
Police use of excessive (and lethal) force is a significant societal issue, often disproportionately affecting underprivileged communities. A major challenge is the lack of accessible, data-driven insights that can help raise awareness and inform policy changes to mitigate instances of police brutality.

To address this, we propose developing a data visualization dashboard that enables users to explore police killing incidents based on demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic factors. This dashboard will provide interactive insights into trends over time, highlight high-risk locations, and analyze the correlation between demographic factors and police use of force.

Our tool will allow government officials and policymakers to identify systemic issues, help the general public understand disparities in law enforcement practices, and support social justice organizations in advocating for better law enforcement training and accountability measures.

Milestone 2 Reflection
1. Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart:
Implementation: We replaced the vertical stacked bar chart with a horizontal one to improve readability and accessibility. The vertical orientation was challenging to interpret due to the large number of categories, and the horizontal layout resolved this issue.
Deviation from Proposal: The gender axis was removed after our data analysis revealed that the vast majority of victims were male, making gender-based analysis less informative for our dashboardâ€™s purpose.

2. Scatter Plot on Map:
Implementation: Instead of a heatmap, we used a scatter plot on a map to visualize the geographic distribution of police killings. This approach provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of data density and location-specific trends.
Deviation from Proposal: The heatmap was replaced because scatter plots on maps are more effective for spatial data interpretation and allow users to pinpoint specific incidents more easily.

3. Enhanced Filtering Options:
Implementation: We added filters for year, age, and armed status (e.g., gun, knife). Additionally, we introduced a filter for the time series plot to allow users to focus on specific time periods.
Deviation from Proposal: These filters were not initially planned but were added to improve interactivity and user control over the data, making the dashboard more dynamic and user-friendly.

4. Top 10 State by police killings Plot:
Implementation: We included a filter to compare police killings across different states, enabling users to select specific states for comparison.
Deviation from Proposal: This feature was enhanced to provide more flexibility in analyzing state-level data, allowing users to explore trends and patterns across regions.

5. Time Series Plot:
Implementation: The time series plot now compares police killings across states instead of genders, as originally proposed.
Deviation from Proposal: This change was made because state-level comparisons were deemed more relevant for understanding trends over time, given the limited variability in gender data.

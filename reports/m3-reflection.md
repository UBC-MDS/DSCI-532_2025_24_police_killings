## Milestone 3 Reflection

### Our Additional Improvements

-   **Enlarged font sizes and legends** to enhance readability, making navigation on the dashboard easier.
-   **Added variable selection** (race/ethnicity, age, armed) for both the map and distribution plots, allowing users to customize the displayed data for better insights.
-   **Converted all filters to dropdowns** with a **"Select All"** button, making filtering more intuitive and efficient.
-   **Replaced the input for top N state plots with a slider (max 25).** This cap minimizes clutter and focuses user attention on the most significant data points, enhancing overall clarity and impact.
-   **Removed the total killings card**, decluttering the interface for a cleaner and more focused user experience.
-   **Removed tabs** so that everything is now viewable on a single page, improving accessibility and navigation.
-   **Changed the dashboardâ€™s color theme to teal** for a more modern and visually appealing interface.
-   **Enhanced the map with interactive zoom and rotation**, allowing users to explore details at the state or city level. *(Inspired by [Group 26](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_26_SMBFinder))*.
-   **Added a loading spinner for plots** to indicate updates after filter changes, improving user experience by providing real-time feedback. *(Inspired by [Group 30](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_30_road-accident-dashboard))*.

### Limitations

-   **Lack of Comparative Analysis:**
    -   The dashboard focuses on individual variables but does not allow side-by-side comparisons (e.g., comparing police killings across different years or regions).
    -   Multi-selection options for filtering and visualizing trends over time would add more analytical power.

### Potential Future Improvements

-   **Enhanced Data Interpretation:**
    -   Add tooltips and contextual insights (e.g., "This spike in 2020 correlates with increased protests and policy changes").
    -   Display percentage changes and summary statistics for better interpretation.
-   **Comparative Analysis Feature:**
    -   Allow users to compare multiple years, regions, or demographic groups on the same plot.
    -   Introduce a dual-axis feature to overlay trends across different variables.

### Things to Reflect (Compared to Last Visual)

- **1. Larger Titles:**  
  - Titles have been significantly enlarged to establish a strong visual hierarchy. These bold headings immediately draw attention to critical sections, making it easier for users to identify the focus of each chart and navigate the dashboard efficiently.

- **2. Enhanced Legends:**  
  - The legends are now bigger and more distinct, providing clear differentiation among various data categories. This adjustment minimizes confusion and allows users to quickly associate each color or symbol with its corresponding data set, streamlining data interpretation.

- **3. Improved Font Sizes:**  
  - All textual elements throughout the dashboard feature increased font sizes. This change enhances overall readability across different devices and screen sizes, while also ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments for a more inclusive experience.

- **4. Organized and Cohesive Layout:**  
  - The combination of larger titles, enhanced legends, and bigger fonts contributes to a more structured and visually appealing presentation. This thoughtful design approach creates a clear visual flow that supports efficient navigation and helps users focus on key information.

- **5. Overall Impact on User Experience:**  
  - These design enhancements elevate both the functionality and aesthetic of the dashboard. By reducing cognitive load and making data easier to read at a glance, the updated design facilitates faster decision-making and reflects a commitment to continuous improvement in user-centric design.

### Things to Improve

- **Consistent Chart Sizing:**  
  - Ensure that both charts displaying the top states with police killings by month maintain identical dimensions. This consistency facilitates direct visual comparison and reduces any perceptual bias if one chart appears larger or more prominent than the other.

- **Cap on Top States:**  
  - Limit the analysis to the top 25 states based on police killings. This cap minimizes clutter and focuses user attention on the most significant data points, enhancing overall clarity and impact.

- **Extended Filter Sidebar:**  
  - Modify the layout so that the filter sidebar stretches continuously to the end of the dashboard. This adjustment provides a seamless interface, ensuring that all filtering options are fully accessible and visually integrated with the rest of the design.

- **Aligned Chart Edges and Data Presentation:**  
  - Remove extraneous details, such as the exact number of police killings on the right side of the top left chart. Instead, focus on aligning the edges of the top and bottom charts for a balanced and professional look.

- **Tab Naming and Consistency:**  
  - Rename the second tab to “Race Distribution” for clarity. Additionally, ensure that titles on the map and race charts share the same font size and styling to reinforce uniformity.

- **Unified Colors and Fonts:**  
  - Harmonize the color schemes and font styles throughout the dashboard. A consistent visual theme enhances readability and overall user engagement.

- **Interactive Map Enhancements:**  
  - Introduce subtle interactivity to the map chart without major overhauls. Consider adding features that allow users to break down the data by different variables, thereby enriching the analytical experience while keeping the design clean and accessible.

- **Card Layout for Consistent Sizing:**  
  - Incorporate a card layout to encapsulate both the filter sidebar and the charts. This approach standardizes dimensions and spacing, ensuring that all components maintain a consistent size. A uniform card design not only improves visual appeal but also creates a more organized and predictable user experience.

### Things to Reflect (Compared to Last Visual)

- **1. Larger Titles:**  
  - Titles have been significantly enlarged to establish a strong visual hierarchy. These bold headings immediately draw attention to critical sections, making it easier for users to identify the focus of each chart and navigate the dashboard efficiently.

- **2. Enhanced Legends:**  
  - The legends are now bigger and more distinct, providing clear differentiation among various data categories. This adjustment minimizes confusion and allows users to quickly associate each color or symbol with its corresponding data set, streamlining data interpretation.

- **3. Improved Font Sizes:**  
  - All textual elements throughout the dashboard feature increased font sizes. This change enhances overall readability across different devices and screen sizes, while also ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments for a more inclusive experience.

- **4. Organized and Cohesive Layout:**  
  - The combination of larger titles, enhanced legends, and bigger fonts contributes to a more structured and visually appealing presentation. This thoughtful design approach creates a clear visual flow that supports efficient navigation and helps users focus on key information.

- **5. Overall Impact on User Experience:**  
  - These design enhancements elevate both the functionality and aesthetic of the dashboard. By reducing cognitive load and making data easier to read at a glance, the updated design facilitates faster decision-making and reflects a commitment to continuous improvement in user-centric design.

### Our Additional Improvements

- **Added variable selection** (race/ethnicity, age, armed) for both the map and distribution plots, allowing users to customize the displayed data for better insights.

- **Converted all filters to dropdowns** with a **"Select All"** button, making filtering more intuitive and efficient.

- **Replaced the input for top N state plots with a slider (max 25).** This cap minimizes clutter and focuses user attention on the most significant data points, enhancing overall clarity and impact.

- **Removed the total killings card**, decluttering the interface for a cleaner and more focused user experience.

- **Removed tabs** so that everything is now viewable on a single page, improving accessibility and navigation.

- **Enhanced the map with interactive zoom and rotation**, allowing users to explore details at the state or city level. *(Inspired by [Group 26](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_26_SMBFinder))*.

- **Changed the dashboardâ€™s color theme to teal** for a more modern and visually appealing interface.

- **Added a loading spinner for plots** to indicate updates after filter changes, improving user experience by providing real-time feedback. *(Inspired by [Group 30](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_30_road-accident-dashboard))*.

### Limitations

- **Lack of Comparative Analysis:**
  - The dashboard focuses on individual variables but does not allow side-by-side comparisons (e.g., comparing police killings across different years or regions).
  - Multi-selection options for filtering and visualizing trends over time would add more analytical power.

### Potential Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Data Interpretation:**
  - Add tooltips and contextual insights (e.g., "This spike in 2020 correlates with increased protests and policy changes").
  - Display percentage changes and summary statistics for better interpretation.

- **Comparative Analysis Feature:**
  - Allow users to compare multiple years, regions, or demographic groups on the same plot.
  - Introduce a dual-axis feature to overlay trends across different variables.
